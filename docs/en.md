# NWPS River Floods

Brings the **river levels of the United States**, their **flood category** and the **official crest
forecast** of the NOAA National Weather Service into Gladys, from the public API of the National
Water Prediction Service (NWPS, the successor of AHPS). No account, no key.

> **This is a complement, not a safety alert system.** Data can be late, missing or wrong, and the
> integration depends on your Gladys, your Internet access and a public service. In a flood, follow
> the official warnings (weather.gov, your local emergency management, 911). This integration is
> not affiliated with NOAA or the National Weather Service. Tested against the live NWPS API, not
> yet on a real Gladys installation: feedback welcome.

## What you get

- **One device per gauge** you follow: the water level (stage) in feet or metres, the flow when
  the gauge reports one, the **flood category** of the NWS (no flooding, action stage, minor,
  moderate, major flooding) as a risk level and in words, and the time of the last reading.
- At the gauges the NWS forecasts (forecast points), the **forecast crest**: the highest level of
  the current official forecast, its time and its flood category.
- What the USGS gauges already in the store do not give: the flood stages of the NWS and its
  forecasts. Readings themselves often come from the USGS: the NWPS relays them.
- A **scene trigger** "River flood category rises", for an observed or a forecast rise.
- A **dashboard widget**: your gauges with their level and category, or one gauge with its
  forecast crest.
- A **"Find gauges"** button that lists the gauges around your house.

## Requirements

- Gladys Assistant **5.3.2** or later (the m³/s unit of the flow in metric units).
- Internet access from Gladys: the integration reads `api.water.noaa.gov`.
- For "around my house" and "Find gauges": the location of your house in Gladys (Settings,
  Houses). With several houses, choose yours in the **House** setting. The integration asks for it
  at installation (the "location" permission); it is only used to find the nearest gauges, rounded
  to about 5 km before it leaves Gladys, never stored nor logged.
- The United States (and the few gauges of the NWS in Puerto Rico and on the borders).

## Configuration

### Settings

| Setting                       | What it does                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Gauge codes                   | NWS codes (four letters and a digit) separated by commas, `BRKM2, ARCF1`, or the addresses of their pages, `https://water.noaa.gov/gauges/brkm2`. |
| House                         | The house whose location is used by "Around my house" and "Find gauges". Empty: the first house of Gladys that has a location.                    |
| Around my house               | Also follows the 3 nearest gauges in service and reporting, within 5, 10 or 25 miles of your house. Off by default.                               |
| Units                         | **Feet, cfs** (default, the units of the NWS) or **metres, m³/s**, for the new devices.                                                           |
| Refresh interval              | 15 (default), 20 or 30 minutes.                                                                                                                   |
| Language of the feature names | Names of the features of new devices, and language of their texts and of the scene variables. French by default.                                  |

At most 20 gauges are followed. Save, then open the **Discover** tab and create the devices you
want. A gauge whose device you created stays followed even if you remove its code from the
settings: delete the device to stop.

Changing the units does not change the devices already created: their features keep the unit
they were created with, and the values follow it. Click **Update** on a device in the Discover
tab to switch it (its history then mixes both units).

### Finding your gauges

The **Find gauges** button lists the gauges in service around the house chosen in the settings
(25 miles, or the chosen distance), nearest first, with their code, distance, current category
and "forecast" when the NWS forecasts them. Copy the codes you want into **Gauge codes**, then
save. The code of a gauge is also shown on its page of water.noaa.gov.

## Devices

One device per gauge, named like the NWS names it ("Potomac River near Washington DC (Little
Falls)"), with the code as `NWS_LID` and the state as `STATE` in its parameters. Its features
are read-only:

| Feature                    | Type (Gladys)        | Value                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Water level                | Liquid depth         | Stage at the gauge, in feet or metres, above the gauge datum (an elevation at some lakes and dams).            |
| Flow (cfs) / Flow          | Water flow           | When the gauge reports one: in cubic feet per second (a unit Gladys does not have: the name says it) or m³/s.  |
| Flood level                | Risk                 | When the gauge has flood stages: 0 no flooding (action stage included), 1 minor, 2 moderate, 3 major flooding. |
| Flood category             | Text                 | The category in words: No flooding, Action stage, Minor flooding… or why there is none (No recent reading…).   |
| Last reading               | Text                 | Time of the last reading, in the time zone of Gladys.                                                          |
| Forecast crest             | Liquid depth or flow | Forecast points only: the highest level of the current forecast (a flow at the few gauges forecast by flow).   |
| Time of the forecast crest | Text                 | Its time, or "No current forecast".                                                                            |
| Forecast flood level       | Risk                 | The flood level of the crest, 0 when there is no current forecast.                                             |
| Forecast flood category    | Text                 | The category of the crest in words.                                                                            |

A reading older than 24 hours is not sent again: the level then shows "no recent value" in
Gladys, and the category "No recent reading".

### Flood categories

The NWS defines, for each forecast point and many other gauges, an **action stage** (time to
prepare, no flooding yet) and the stages of **minor**, **moderate** and **major flooding**, from
the impacts seen in past floods. The integration publishes the category the NWS computes: it
does not compare the levels itself. A gauge without flood stages ("No flood stages") has no
flood level feature. Many forecast points are only forecast during high water: between two
events, their forecast reads "No current forecast".

## Dashboard widget

Add the **River gauges** widget to a dashboard:

- without a gauge chosen: one line per gauge with its level and category, green (no flooding),
  yellow (action stage, minor) or red (moderate, major), and a heading when a gauge is in flood
  or forecast in flood;
- with a gauge chosen: its level and flow tiles, its category, the forecast crest with its time
  and category, its flood stage and its last reading.

The levels of the lines follow the units of your Gladys profile; the tiles show the unit of the
features. The **water.noaa.gov** button opens the page of the gauge; a setting hides it.

## Scene triggers

**River flood category rises** fires when the category of a created gauge goes up to action
stage, minor, moderate or major flooding, observed or forecast. Filters: the gauge, observed or
forecast, the new category. Variables for your messages: `gauge_name`, `category_name`,
`source_name` (observed or forecast), `value` (the level with its unit) and `time` (of the
reading or of the crest), in the language of the configuration.

It fires once per rise: again only after the category went down. The last categories are kept
in `/data`, so a rise during a restart fires once, and the first reading of a new gauge fires
nothing.

For a threshold of your own, use the native trigger of Gladys on a device value: "Flood level
greater than or equal to 1" (minor flooding), or "Forecast crest above 9 ft".

## Scene examples

- _Flood forecast_: trigger "River flood category rises", forecast, minor, moderate or major →
  send the message "{{gauge_name}}: {{category_name}} forecast, crest {{value}} at {{time}}".
- _Minor flooding observed_: trigger on the device value "Flood level ≥ 1" → notify and switch
  on a warning light.
- _Back to normal_: trigger on the device value "Flood level = 0" → send "The river is back
  below flood stage".

## Data source, quotas and licence

- Source: the **National Water Prediction Service** of the NOAA National Weather Service,
  `https://api.water.noaa.gov/nwps/v1/` (`/gauges/{lid}` for each gauge, `/gauges?bbox…` for the
  gauges around the house). Data of the U.S. government, public domain; credit: NOAA / NWS.
- No account, no key, no published quota. The integration asks for each followed gauge once per
  refresh (every 15 minutes by default, 20 gauges at most), one after the other, with a
  User-Agent naming the integration, and looks for the gauges around the house once a day.
- Readings of many gauges come from the USGS and other partners, relayed by the NWPS.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Unknown gauge codes"**: a code of the settings is not an NWS gauge. Check it on
  water.noaa.gov, or use **Find gauges**. A USGS site number (8 digits) is not an NWS code.
- **"The NWPS API does not answer"**: Gladys cannot reach `api.water.noaa.gov`, or the service is
  down. The integration tries again at every refresh, and the status comes back by itself.
- **"No house of Gladys has a location"**: set the location of your house in Settings, Houses,
  or turn "Around my house" off.
- **No forecast crest**: the gauge is not a forecast point, or the NWS has no current forecast
  for it (common outside high water).
- **Old values**: the last reading is shown in "Last reading". A gauge that stopped reporting
  reads "No recent reading".
- Logs: Integrations → NWPS River Floods → logs; `LOG_LEVEL=debug` shows every refresh.

## Limits

- A complement, not a safety alert system: the NWS warnings and your local authorities prevail.
- The NWPS gives the crest of the forecast, not the whole forecast curve nor its uncertainty.
- Flood categories exist only where the NWS defined flood stages.
- The flow in cfs has no unit in Gladys (the name says "cfs"); in metric units it is in m³/s.
- Developed and tested against the live NWPS API, without a real Gladys installation: feedback
  welcome.
